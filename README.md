# AiChecker
AiChecker is an Ai Plagiarism detection tool which aims to ensure the authenticity of written content across various sectors. AiChecker can help academic institutions (with LMS integration), publishers, and legal firms in differentiating between human-authored texts and AI-generated content. This technology ensures the integrity of communications, promoting transparency and ethical standards as the worlds get concerningly dominated by AI-generated material. 
AiChecker is a deployed model that uses FastAPI to handle uploads of PDF or DOCX files. It extracts text with LangChain data loaders and employs a RapidAPI service to identify AI-generated content, ensuring academic integrity.
## Features

-Document Upload: Supports PDF and DOCX files where users can upload documents to be checked for AI-generated content.
-AI Detection: Integrates with AI content identifier APIs to assess whether content is generated by AI.
-Text Extraction: Utilizes LangChain data loaders for efficient text extraction from the uploaded documents.
-User-Friendly Interface: Provides a straightforward interface for uploading and analyzing documents.
